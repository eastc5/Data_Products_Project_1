Below is a simple interactive map of the UK showing the 147 weather observation station locations used by the UK Met office. The data was correct when it was created 20/02/2017. Image was created using R and leaflet. Link to the gitbub repo is here: https://github.com/eastc5/Data_Products_Project_1

```{R}
library(jsonlite)
library(leaflet)

sites<-as.data.frame(fromJSON(txt = "./data/sitelist.json"))
names(sites)<-c("elevation","id","lat","lng","name","region","unitaryAurthArea","obsSource","nationalPark")
siteslatlng<-sites[,c("lat","lng")]
sitesnames<-sites[,"name"]
siteslatlng$lat<-as.numeric(siteslatlng$lat)
siteslatlng$lng <-as.numeric(siteslatlng$lng)

siteslatlng %>% leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers(popup = sitesnames,clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
```
